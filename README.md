# Digital Shorthand Key

The aim of this project is to quickly send text in a digital medium. I will utilize a machine learning algorithm to learn to recognize characters in digital writing from the new shorthand I developed last year. The second part of the algorithm will then convert the Digital Shorthand Key (DSK) into English text. I will then train the algorithm to recognize the characters via training and testing data and measure loss. I will also write a series of rules to turn the shorthand into English from the DSK. This program would prove to be useful for those in time sensitive situations where they do not have time to type up a message to send on a traditional keyboard. Machine learning well adapted to these tasks such as Natural Language Processing and image recognition and transcription. Furthermore, numerous qualities of shorthands have been examined in order to help make the Digital Shorthand Key that this project will be using.
